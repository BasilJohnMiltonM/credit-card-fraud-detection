# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores fraud detection in financial transactions using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning Models**. The dataset used contains credit card transactions labeled as **fraudulent (1) or genuine (0)**. The main focus is on handling **class imbalance**, understanding transaction patterns, and building a **predictive model**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Class distribution
  - Feature correlations
  - Transaction patterns (time & amount)
- **Outlier Detection**: Boxplots and histograms to detect anomalies.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Training classifiers to detect fraud.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform in-depth EDA to understand transaction patterns:
- **Class Imbalance Check**: Fraudulent transactions are much rarer.
- **Feature Correlation Heatmap**: Identifying relationships between features.
- **Transaction Amount & Time Distributions**: Visualizing spending patterns.
- **Boxplots for Outlier Detection**: Identifying extreme values.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Details
The dataset consists of **credit card transactions** with the following key features:
- `Time`: Seconds elapsed since the first transaction.
- `Amount`: Transaction value.
- `V1, V2, ..., V28`: PCA-transformed features.
- `Class`: 0 for **genuine**, 1 for **fraudulent** transactions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
- **Feature importance analysis** shows which attributes contribute to fraud detection.
- **Machine Learning models** trained and evaluated for effectiveness.
- **Potential improvements** for real-world fraud detection systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Implement **Deep Learning** techniques for better fraud detection.
- Explore **real-time fraud detection** with streaming data.
- Deploy a **fraud detection API** for practical applications.
